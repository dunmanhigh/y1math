# Welcome to Y1 Math with Python programming!

By programming your solutions to math problems, you
- gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical thinking processes
- can quickly verify your answers (eg test if a big number is prime)
- are empowered to automate calculation (let the machine do the hard work)

Current topics:
- Primes, Highest Common Factor and Lowest Common Multiple
- Number Patterns

Please contribute! Submit pull requests for
- problems without solutions
- problems with incomplete/partial solutions
- problems with alternative solutions (yes sometimes there are more than one way to solve a problem and we really welcome them!)
- interesting and related problems not limited to those currently available
- anything you feel this repository can be improved
- anything you feel this repository can be improved
